# math482 project

## some kind of monte carlo tree search
Which seems to be nearly going.

## other things
Throw a neural network (most likely of the convolutional variety) in it somewhere eventually.
- possibly to estimate value function
- or Q
  - possibly do Q, then train a smaller net to approximate the output and use in the rollouts?
